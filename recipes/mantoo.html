    <p><strong>Afghan Mantoo or Manti as known in some countries</strong></p>
    <p>Throughout Central Asia, delicious dumplings of all 
        kinds are a staple of the local cuisine. Mantoo 
        (or Mantu) is a popular traditional Afghan dish 
        consisting of steamed dumplings filled with spiced 
        ground meat and onions, or called Ashak when filled 
        with a vegetarian leek filling. In Afghanistan they 
        are served alongside split yellow lentils and a rich 
        tomato gravy, then topped with fresh yoghurt and mint sauce. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Ground meat</li>
        <li>Onions</li>

    </ul>    


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add flour, salt, and oil to the mixer bowl.</li>
        <li>Next, start your mixer slowly and slowly add water. Donâ€™t rush it. (Alternatively, you can knead by hand and slowly add water as you go)</li>
        <li>After that, you will have to start trusting your eye. You have to let the water incorporate with your dry ingredients. You can eventually turn the mixer on high.</li>
        <li>After a few minutes, you should notice the dough coming together. It will start to look like a stretchy piece of dough and will begin to grab your dough hook.</li>
        <li>Want to knead by hand for about 6-7 minutes</li>
        <li>Add oil to pan.</li>
        <li>After the oil is heated, add onion. Sautee onion for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then, add tomato sauce and spices. Stir and simmer for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finally, add vinegar, cook for 2 minutes, set aside.</li>
    </ol>
