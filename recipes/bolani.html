    <h1>Bolani Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../img/bolani.jpg">

    <p><strong>Bolani is a stuffed flatbread from the Afghan cuisine. It is usually filled with a mix of potatoes, cilantro, and green peppers, but it can also be filled with pumpkin, red lentils, or chives. It is usually served with a green chutney and enjoyed as a side dish, or as a snack with a cup of tea.</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1½ Tbsp (23ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1½ tsp (9g) salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp instant yeast</li>
        <li>3 cups + 1 Tbsp (415g) bread flour </li>
        <li>2 large potatoes, peeled, cut into 1 cm cubes</li>
        <li>6 stalks green onion, sliced †</li>
        <li>1 cup (16g) fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green chili pepper, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp (1.9g) ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp (6g) salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2½ Tbsp (38ml) vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the water, oil, salt, and yeast. Stir.</li>
        <li>Then add the flour. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Then knead the dough for a few minutes, until soft and elastic*. Add a bit more flour as needed if the dough is too sticky. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling water for 15 minutes. When the potatoes are fully cooked through, drain and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the green onion, cilantro, chili pepper, and spices to the bowl as well. Use a fork or potato masher to mash everything. It's okay if a few lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 8 pieces.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece into a ball with your hands. Dust each ball with flour.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour on your working surface. Use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a thin circle about 20 - 22 cm in diameter, about as thin as a tortilla. The thinner the better, but not too thin that it will rip if handled.</li>
        <li>Gently lift the rolled-out dough and re-flour your working surface. Spread ⅓ cup of the potato filling over half of the dough, leaving a ½ inch (1 cm) border along the edge. Dip your fingers in water and spread the water along this edge, only on one half of the circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough in half, over the filling, to create a half-moon shape. Press out all the air bubbles, then pinch the edges with your fingers to fully seal the bolani.</li>
        <li>Add a bit of the oil to a large pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the bolani to the pan. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes. Meanwhile, use a silicone pastry brush to brush some more oil on top of the bolani.</li>
        <li>When the bottom is golden, flip, and let cook on the other side until golden. Then transfer to a cooling rack. Continue with the remaining bolani.</li>
        <li>Cut the bolani in triangles and serve with green chutney. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
